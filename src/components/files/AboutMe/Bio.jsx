      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a B.Tech student passionate about development 
      and machine learning, blending technical expertise with 
      leadership. As a Core ML Team Member at UiPath and Senior
      Executive for Sponsorship & PR at FED-KIIT, I’ve honed skills
      in project management, strategic communication, and teamwork.
      My experience as Marketing Lead at KIIT Robotics Society further 
      strengthened my ability to manage teams and execute impactful 
      projects. Outside academics, I enjoy exploring tech trends and
      gaining fresh perspectives through podcasts. Always eager to 
      collaborate on meaningful projects and connect with like-minded 
      individuals in tech.
